# XLStoXLSXconverter
Converter for excel files from the old format .xls to the newer .xlsx.
For the moment it's really basic and rudimental, it's able to extract just the text. I'm planning to update it so that it will be able to copy also the text format and possibly the cell styles. Would be interesting also to explore the possibility to copy formulas.
